			City Councilman Rory Lancman was surrounded.
		</p>

		<p>
			He’d come to the Queens Community Board 8 meeting just to say thanks for his win in that week’s primary election. But as Lancman finished his remarks and made for the exit, two dozen attendees rose from their seats and followed him to the back of the room. Most were older, and several used walkers or canes. But they made such a ruckus that they were asked to leave the meeting. In the dark, outside the Hillcrest Jewish Community Center, they formed a ring around the Councilman, raising their voices and gesturing emphatically. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The reason for their anger? A daycare center that doesn’t exist yet.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Right now, Great Sunshine Daycare is just a hole in the ground. But its neighbors on 67th Ave. in sleepy Fresh Meadows, Queens, are already mobilizing against the project. The result is a revival of the community’s long-dormant civic life—and a spotlight on tensions between legacy residents and new arrivals. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Bill and Tomi Anello, who live down the street from the construction site, are leading the charge.  They say that the neighborhood is already oversaturated with daycares—by their count, there are as many as 20 within a mile of Great Sunshine. (An independent search revealed 16, three of which reported few to no vacancies.) 
		</p>

		<p>
			They’re also concerned about the traffic that the daycare will bring to the already-congested street, which is also home to P.S. 173, a large elementary school just two blocks away. 
		</p>

		<p>
			“Just with the school being here, we have traffic down to 171st St.,” Tomi Anello said. “We’ve got bottlenecks like you wouldn’t believe.”
		</p>

		<p>
			And those are just the first few on their list of grievances, which also includes air pollution, noise, an overtaxed sewer system, property damage, and mosquitoes at the construction site.
		</p>

		<p>
			The neighbors have made their opposition eminently clear. Under the banner of the Flushing Heights Civic Association, they’ve held weekly meetings; drafted a petition with 400 signatures; sent an eight-page letter, complete with Zoning Resolution citations, to the Department of Buildings; reached out to their local representatives; and even held a rally outside the construction site. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It’s the most activity the Civic Association has seen in years, said Jim DeBonet, who ran the organization for years before stepping down due to health problems. John Callari, who serves on the board of the nearby Fresh Meadows Civic Association, expressed cautious optimism for the group’s future.
		</p>

		<p>
			“A civic is an important thing,” he said. “I hope these people out here continue to support it.”
		</p>	

		<p>
			The neighbors’ organized approach appears to be working. Mike Tang, the owner of Great Sunshine, says that he’s heard the Civic Association’s complaints and altered his plans accordingly. A letter Tang shared with residents in July describes the proposed changes, including a first-floor parking lot and staggered pickup/dropoff times to help mitigate traffic.
		</p>	

		<p>
			The neighbors say they remain unconvinced. Tomi Anello called the letter’s contents “lies,” and she and Casalino felt that the letter Tang gave them wasn’t shared widely enough.
		</p>

		<p>
			Tang, meanwhile, sees the opposition as the work of a handful of agitators—who are almost exclusively older white men and women.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			“I do feel that there’s kind of bias or hostility,” he said. “When we talk with some other people—not white—they say, ‘OK, why not, we do need a good community facility.’” 
		</p>

		<p>
			Asked to comment on the allegations, Amy Tam-Liao said that she’d seen people of all different races at the opposition meetings—but that her husband, Hsi-Pei Liao, saw a different crowd at Monday’s protest.
		</p>

		<p>
			“He said it was all older white people at the protest,” Tam-Liao said, paraphrasing her husband.
		</p>

		<p>
			The contrast speaks to the changing demographics of Queens’s 8th District, which according to the American Community Survey saw a 23% increase in its Asian population between 2006 and 2016. (The general population increased 13% in the same time period.)
		</p>

		<p>
			“The area changed,” said Casalino. “But everybody keeps their lawns nice, everybody’s quiet, everybody respects everybody else."
		</p>

		<p>
			Her comments spoke to the experience of longtime residents: all had vivid memories the Fresh Meadows of the past, paired with a fierce commitment to the Fresh Meadows of the future.

			“We love this area, and we won’t move out of it,” Tomi Anello said. “Bill and I say, ‘They’re gonna take us away in a box.’”
